# Parserator

Parserator is a toolkit for creating custom natural language processing (NLP) parsers for domain-specific data extraction tasks. It provides a framework for training, testing, and deploying probabilistic parsers that can extract structured information from unstructured text.

## Problem

Extracting structured data from messy, inconsistently formatted text is a common challenge in data processing. Traditional regex-based approaches often fail to handle the variability and ambiguity present in real-world data, while generic NLP tools may not be tailored to specific domains.

## Solution

Parserator addresses this challenge by:

- Providing a framework for creating custom parsers trained on domain-specific data
- Leveraging conditional random fields (CRF) for probabilistic sequence labeling
- Offering tools for training, testing, and deploying parsers as Python packages

## Features

- **Domain-specific parsing**: Create parsers tailored to specific data formats like addresses, names, or product descriptions
- **Probabilistic approach**: Uses machine learning to handle variations and ambiguities in text
- **Easy training**: Simple interface for training models with labeled examples
- **Python integration**: Deploy parsers as Python packages for seamless integration into data pipelines

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- python-crfsuite
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning

## My Contribution

I contributed to the Parserator project by:

1. Implementing improved feature extraction for address parsing
2. Enhancing documentation and creating tutorials for new users
3. Developing test cases to ensure parser accuracy
4. Optimizing performance for large-scale data processing tasks

## Results

The parsers built with Parserator have been successfully used in various data cleaning and extraction projects, achieving significantly higher accuracy than rule-based approaches. The toolkit has been adopted by data scientists and developers working with messy, real-world data across multiple domains.
